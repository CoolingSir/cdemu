Installation instructions:
===========================

To install this program you will need to have CMake installed. To make 
configuration a little more enjoyable you should also install a frontend.
CCMake is a ncurses frontend. There exists graphical frontends too.

1. First you will need to create a build directory. If your sourcecode is
   installed in ~/cdemu/package/ then create a sub-directory called
   'build' and change into it.

   cd ~/cdemu/package/
   mkdir build && cd build

2. Now start ccmake to configure the software. You need to specify on its
   command line the path to where your package is located. Since you
   are now in ~/cdemu/package/build/ your software is installed in
   ~/cdemu/package/ which is the parent directory, in other words ".."

   ccmake ..

3. Press 'C' to bring up the configuration screen. Here you can change any
   settings that you want. When you are ready press 'C' once and then 'G'.

4. Now you are ready to compile and install.

   make
   sudo make install
