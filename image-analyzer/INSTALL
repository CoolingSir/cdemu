Installation instructions:
===========================

To build and install this package, you will need to have CMake installed.
You can also install and use a frontend, such as ccmake or cmake-gui; the
instructions below assume you are using plain command-line interface.

1. Unpack the source and create a build directory inside it; i.e., if you
   unpacked the source into ~/cdemu/package/, create a sub-directory called
   'build' and change into it:

   cd ~/cdemu/package/
   mkdir build && cd build

2. Now start cmake to configure the software; the required argument is
   the path to the source, which, in this example, is the parent folder:

   cmake ..

   You can also specify additional options, such as installation prefix
   and build type:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

3. Now you are ready to compile and install:

   make
   sudo make install
