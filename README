gCDEmu
v.1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is gCDEmu, a GNOME applet for controlling CDEmu daemon. It is part of the 
userspace-cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.

It provides a graphic interface that allows performing the key tasks related to
controlling the CDEmu daemon, such as loading and unloading devices, displaying 
devices' status and retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.

In addition, the applet listens to signals emitted by CDEmu daemon and provides
notifications via libnotify (provided that python bindings are installed).


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - python 2.4 or newer
 - PyGTK, PyGObject and PyGNOME 2.6 or newer; 
   (gnomeapplet and gconf modules are required)
 - D-BUS python bindings
 - intltool
 
 - notify-python (optional)

 
Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation process is generic ./configure, make, make install as described in
INSTALL file.


Note that if during make, you get the following error:
    make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/gcdemu-1.0.0/po'
    file=`echo sl | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
    && rm -f $file && -o $file sl.po
    /bin/sh: -o: not found
    make[1]: *** [sl.gmo] Error 127
it means you don't have intltool installed.


Troubleshooting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: gCDEmu's tray icon is greyed and the applet does nothing!
A: Greyed-out icon means that the applet failed to connect to the CDEmu daemon. 
   Please make sure the daemon is running and that you're connecting via 
   appropriate bus.
