CDEmu client
v.1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is cdemu-client, a simple command-line client for controlling CDEmu daemon.
It is part of the userspace-cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator 
for linux.

It provides a way to perform the key tasks related to controlling the CDEmu
daemon, such as loading and unloading devices, displaying devices' status and
retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - python 2.4 or newer
 - D-BUS python bindings
 - intltool


Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation process is generic ./configure, make, make install as described in
INSTALL file.


Note that if during make, you get the following error:
    make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/cdemu-client-1.0.0/po'
    file=`echo sl | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
    && rm -f $file && -o $file sl.po
    /bin/sh: -o: not found
    make[1]: *** [sl.gmo] Error 127
it means you don't have intltool installed.
 
 
Usage examples:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read cdemu-client's man page or run 'cdemu -h' for more information on commands
and their syntax.


Loading a single image to first device:
 cdemu load 0 ~/image.mds
 
Loading multiple-file image to first device:
 cdemu load 0 ~/session1.toc ~/session2.toc ~/session3.toc
 
Unloading first device:
 cdemu load 0

Listing supported debug masks for library and daemon:
 cdemu device-debug-masks library
 cdemu device-debug-masks daemon

Obtaining library debug mask for the first device:
 cdemu device-debug 0 library
 
Setting daemon debug mask for the first device:
 cdemu device-debug 0 daemon 0x01


System vs. session bus:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When connecting to daemon, cdemu client can use either session or system bus. By
hard-coded default, it uses system bus. The default bus to be used can be specified
in ~/.cdemu file, with following format:

# This is example cdemu client config file. Save it as ~/.cdemu.

[defaults]
#bus=system
bus=session

# End of config file

The default can be overriden by using --bus option. E.g.:
 cdemu --bus=session status
or
 cdemu --bus=system status
