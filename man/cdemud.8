.SH NAME
cdemud \- The CDEmu daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cdemud
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is CDEmu daemon, the userspace daemon part of the userspace-cdemu suite, a
free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.

It receives SCSI commands from kernel module and processes them, passing the
requested data back to the kernel. Daemon implements the actual virtual device;
one instance per each device registered by kernel module. It uses libMirage, an
image access library that is part of userspace-cdemu suite, for the image access
(e.g. sector reading).

The daemon registers itself on D-BUS' system or session bus (depending on the
options passed to it) where it exposes an interface that can be used by clients
to control it.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -n --num-devices=N
Number of devices. Specifies the number of virtual devices the daemon instance should
register with kernel module and control. By default, 1 virtual device is created.
.TP
.B -c --ctl-device=path
Control device. Specifies the control device path. Control device is a character device
provided by kernel module; it is used for communication between kernel and userspace
part of CDEmu suite. By default, /dev/vhba_ctl is used.
.TP
.B -a --audio-driver=driver
Audio driver. Specifies audio driver to be used by virtual devices' audio play.
Since libao is used for audio playback, any valid libao driver can be specified.
If \fBdefault\fR is used as a driver, then libao's default driver is used. Few
examples of valid libao drivers are \fBalsa\fR, \fBoss\fR, \fBpulse\fR or \fBnull\fR.
For all drivers, default device is used. By default, if audio driver is not explicitly
specified via this option, \fBnull\fR is used.
.TP
.B -b --bus=bus_type
Bus type. Valid options are \fBsystem\fR or \fBsession\fR. By default, session bus is used.
(Please note that since v.1.3.0, the running of CDEmu daemon on system bus is considered
deprecated and is discouraged for security reasons).
.TP
.B -l --logfile=logfile
Log file to write logging output into. By default, use of log file is disabled and messages
are written to stdout.
.TP
.B -? --help
Display the help message.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Running daemon on default bus with PulseAudio audio driver and 4 virtual devices:
cdemud --num-devices=4 --audio-driver=pulse
.TP
.B Running daemon on system bus with 2 virtual devices and logging redirected to a file:
cdemud --num-devices=2 --bus=system --logfile=/tmp/cdemu-daemon.log
