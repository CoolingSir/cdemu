libMirage
v.1.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is libMirage library, a CD-ROM image access library, and part of the 
userspace-cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux. It is
written in C and based on GLib.

The aim of libMirage is to provide uniform access to the data stored in 
different image formats, by creating a representation of disc stored in image 
file, which is based on GObjects. There are various objects that represent 
different parts of the disc; disc, session, track, sector, etc. In addition to
providing access to data provided by the image file, libMirage is also capable 
of generating some of the data that might not be present in image file. For 
instance, ISO image provides only user data from sector, without sync pattern, 
header, ECC/EDC codes or subchannel. When this missing data is requested, 
libMirage will transparently generate it.

Currently supported image formats:
 - B6T: BlindWrite 5/6 file format
 - C2D: Roxio / WinOnCD file format (experimental)
 - CCD: CloneCD image format
 - CDI: DiscJuggler image format (experimental)
 - CIF: Easy CD Creator image format (experimental)
 - CUE: CDRwin CUE/BIN image format
 - DAA: PowerISO Direct Access Archive
 - ISO: classic ISO9660 image format
 - MDS: Alcohol 120% image format
 - NRG: Nero image format
 - TOC: cdrdao's TOC/BIN image format

libMirage has a plug-in based system, which allows a simple addition of new
image format parsers or data-file access fragments. It also supports runtime
debugging via debug traces; there are special debug context objects that can
be attached to other objects and used to control the amount of verbosity.
