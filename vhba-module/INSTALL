Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the kernel module and other files.
     (Needs root permission)

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

To properly set permissions on VHBA control device and/or set up module
auto-load, see the corresponding sections below.

Compilers and Options
=====================

You can explicitly specify the kernel for which to compile the module for
by setting the environment variable KERNELRELEASE. The default if it is not
specified is 'uname -r' in other words your running kernel.

It is also possible to set extra compiler flags through the EXTRA_CFLAGS
environment variable.

Setting Permissions on VHBA Control Device
==========================================

In order to use VHBA control device, a user must have read-write permissions
on /dev/vhba_ctl. Typically, this is achieved by a udev rule:

KERNEL=="vhba_ctl", MODE="0660", OWNER="root", GROUP="cdrom"

The rule should be stored in a .rule file (for example, 40-vhba.rules) in either
/lib/udev/rules.d or /etc/udev/rules.d directory.

In the above example, the user needs to be part of 'cdrom' group.

Automatic Module Loading
========================

At the moment, automatic module loading can be enabled in a distribution-specific way.

On debian- and ubuntu-based systems, 'vhba' should be added to the /etc/modules file.

On fedora-based systems, a file called vhba.conf and containing a line 'vhba'
should be created in /etc/modules-load.d directory.
